# firstproject: The Album Lister

Welcome to Anthony Quinn's Album Lister! The purpose of this app is to keep an array of your favorite albums based on artists you enter in search bars!

1. Getting Started
When you first load up the app, you will be immediately directed to the home page.  Contained within is a stylish colored view with different thumbnail buttons
that correspond to where you need to go. At the bottom of the screen are tabs that you can use to navigate to the different pages too.

2a. Personal Favorite Album List
Within an orange border is the album list button. Clicking on it takes you to the album list page, where you can enter album names in the text bar 
and it will display in an array. This album list uses context and global variables to communicate with the album API, which is explained further down.

2b. Profile
In a purple border is the profile button. This will take you to the profile page where you can enter your name and email information and store it using
Async Storage. 

2c. Developer
In a yellow border is the developer button. This gives a brief background on me, as well as my interests, class standing, and where I would take this 
app is I were to continue it. I have also included a Body Mass Index Calculator and a Github Repo API for fun.  Enter a github username to display all 
of that person's repositories.  Enter your weight in pounds and height in inches to calculate your BMI.

2d. Artist Album API
Finally, within an aqua border is the Album API.  This page works by taking in an artist's name and returning a flatlist of all of their released albums
within a certain year range.  When you click on one of the album buttons in the list, it communicates with the personal favorite album list page and adds
that album to the array in that page.

3a. Navigation Tabs
At the bottom of the page are tabs that will navigate to the same pages as mentioned above, as well as two additions that are not buttons on the home page.

3b. Feedback
Feel free to give some feedback on the app, what you like and dislike, what could be augmented or expanded upon, as well as what needs improvment.

3c. Display Feedback
This is more for my personal use and debug purposes, but if you want to view the feedback you post, you can display it by clicking on the corresponding
button.  You can also clear the feedback cache. 

4. Closing Thoughts
This has been a detailed README for how Anthony Quinn's Album Lister works. It is still in early stages but hopefully you find some enjoyment and 
appreciation from it! Thank you very much for your time!
